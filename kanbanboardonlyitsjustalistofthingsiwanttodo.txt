LIST OF FEATURES I WANT TO MAKE
- bing image search for artist/song title and show image
- image search thru wikipedia (with caption would actually be rlly cool)
- scrape rate your music, or maybe other review sites too, for snippet of review
- pitchfork review snippet
- some analytics thing, like genre, or maybe some running tally of something (think on this one more)
- genius api -- can we get the overall song analysis if its there?
    - yes, but all api calls (for a server side app) have to be authenticated via bearer token
    - is it worth it to do login to get that info? probably eventually but not now
- get tweets from artist?


LIST OF IDEAS THAT I MAY SCRAp
- playing card or other type of theme for the album cover and artist and stuff?
    - like as the aesthetic pervading all the possible things to show, to
    have some more consistency across things. idk tho bc i like it minimalistic

LIST OF FUN THINGS THAT I HOPEFULLY COULD EVENTUALLY GET TO
- some songs are special easter eggs that color the font in a special way,
    add a special picture, etc.
    - ex with hosono house i could make the title color be the blue of the album

LIST OF THINGS I NEED TO DO BEFORE I RELEASE THE FIRST VERSION
- buy domain
- setup aws cloudfront distro
- fix that pausing bug
- change initial album pic with steps to get streaming going on your device
- make images line up with the album cover
